# AIS Service Catalog
Publisher: Applied Information Sciences
=========
This repo is for the AIS Azure Service Catalog webapp.

AIS Service Catalog is a product that creates a catalog of technologies pre-approved by IT, allowing application development teams to quickly onboard technologies via a self-service portal. This eliminates the friction â€“ developers can quickly provision technologies and create solutions that meet their deadlines. IT can manage and provision new technologies, enforcing corporate governance. With the AIS Service Catalog, these competing needs can meet in the middle, all while quickly implementing a cloud strategy (ADMIN CREDENTIALS NEEDED).
